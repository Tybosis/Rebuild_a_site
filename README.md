Rebuild_a_site
==============

homework assignment for Foundations 1

In this project I have created an HTML5 skeleton of the website Samharris.org.  I started by
creating a text outline of the site's structure, and then created a separate file with the html skeleton.
The resources I used were: 
  
  • The Html outliner tool http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/
  
  • Hannah the TA's html rebuild https://gist.github.com/nowhannahwon/411421e65f3c82e871d2
  
  • Dale Sande's slide deck on HTML5 (URL below)
